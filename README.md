# Deep Mutational Scanning of SARS-CoV-2 N-terminal Domain

Analysis of deep mutational scanning of barcoded codon variants of SARS-CoV-2 NTD. 

Study and analysis by Keara Malone, Tyler Starr, Allie Greaney, [Jesse Bloom](https://research.fredhutch.org/bloom/en.html).

Modeled on the full study of [deep mutational scanning of SARS-CoV-2 RBD](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31003-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867420310035%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).
